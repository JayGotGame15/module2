    <h3>LSU</h3>
    <img src="images/LSU.png" alt="LSU" width ="460" height ="260">
    <p>LSU is a really good college I chose it for only one reason because they always pull out weird plays to win a major game
      their coach is amazing. He has always turned out to do somthing that players may think is impossible
  but his faith and how much hope he has is just all out crazy but not one time he hasn't trusted his team and they
  got it done so that's why I chose this team. to view more<a href="#">click here<a/></p>
    <h3>Murray State</h3>
    <img src="images/MURR.png" alt="MURR PACERS" width="450"height="350">
    <p>Murray state one of my favorite colleges because of one player who didn't expect to
       make it there
    but he ended up being one of the biggest college players in the nation
     his name is Ja Morant, he is one of my insporations he never expected it to happen he put
      in the work and got the outcome of what he put in.
  Never known his future never predicted it he just did it. So that's really why I like murray state not because how he changed it but the impact he had
on it. To view more<a href="#">click here<a/></p>
